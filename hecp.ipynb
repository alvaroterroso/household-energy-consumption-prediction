    "## Column meanings and purpose in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains **minute-level electricity measurements** from a single household (Sceaux, France), collected over a long period (Dec 2006–Nov 2010). Each row is one timestamp, and the variables describe the household’s electrical load both at an overall level and for three specific appliance groups (sub-meterings). The dataset also contains a small proportion of missing measurements (~1.25%), meaning some timestamps exist but the sensor values may be absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datetime\n",
    "- **Meaning:** The exact date and time of the measurement (one-minute resolution).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Enables time-series analysis and feature engineering (hour, day of week, seasonality, holidays), and supports forecasting (next minute/hour/day consumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_active_power\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **active power** consumed by the household at that minute (typically in **kW**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** This is usually the **main target variable** for forecasting/monitoring because it represents the real power used by appliances. It can also be converted into energy and cost estimates over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_reactive_power\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **reactive power** at that minute (typically in **kVAR**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps characterize the type of electrical load (inductive/capacitive appliances). It can provide additional predictive signal and insight into efficiency/power quality, even though it is not “useful work” energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage\n",
    "- **Meaning:** The household supply **voltage** at that minute (in **V**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Captures grid/supply fluctuations that can affect current draw and power consumption. Useful for diagnosing abnormal behaviour and improving prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_intensity\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **current intensity** drawn by the household at that minute (in **A**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Another view of instantaneous load. Since power is related to voltage and current, this feature is strongly tied to consumption peaks and can help models detect high-load periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_1\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by the **kitchen** appliance group during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Provides appliance-group breakdown of consumption, supporting more detailed behavioural analysis (cooking patterns) and enabling models to learn which activities drive peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_2\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by the **laundry room** appliance group during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps identify energy usage linked to washing/drying routines and supports targeted insights (e.g., shifting laundry to cheaper hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_3\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by **electric water heating and air conditioning** during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Often linked to strong **seasonal effects** (heating/cooling). It is key for analysing winter/summer consumption patterns and improving forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra derived consumption (not directly measured by sub-meterings)\n",
    "The dataset notes that:\n",
    "- **Other (unmetered) minute energy** can be estimated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Other\\_energy\\_Wh} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Global\\_active\\_power} \\times 1000}{60}\\right) - \\text{Sub\\_metering\\_1} - \\text{Sub\\_metering\\_2} - \\text{Sub\\_metering\\_3}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Energy consumed by all equipment **not covered** by the three sub-meterings (e.g., lighting, electronics, small appliances).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Allows a more complete breakdown of household consumption and can be a useful additional feature/target for analysis.\n"
