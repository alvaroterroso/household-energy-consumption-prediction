    "## Column meanings and purpose in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains **minute-level electricity measurements** from a single household (Sceaux, France), collected over a long period (Dec 2006–Nov 2010). Each row is one timestamp, and the variables describe the household’s electrical load both at an overall level and for three specific appliance groups (sub-meterings). The dataset also contains a small proportion of missing measurements (~1.25%), meaning some timestamps exist but the sensor values may be absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datetime\n",
    "- **Meaning:** The exact date and time of the measurement (one-minute resolution).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Enables time-series analysis and feature engineering (hour, day of week, seasonality, holidays), and supports forecasting (next minute/hour/day consumption).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_active_power\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **active power** consumed by the household at that minute (typically in **kW**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** This is usually the **main target variable** for forecasting/monitoring because it represents the real power used by appliances. It can also be converted into energy and cost estimates over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_reactive_power\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **reactive power** at that minute (typically in **kVAR**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps characterize the type of electrical load (inductive/capacitive appliances). It can provide additional predictive signal and insight into efficiency/power quality, even though it is not “useful work” energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Voltage\n",
    "- **Meaning:** The household supply **voltage** at that minute (in **V**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Captures grid/supply fluctuations that can affect current draw and power consumption. Useful for diagnosing abnormal behaviour and improving prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global_intensity\n",
    "- **Meaning:** Total **current intensity** drawn by the household at that minute (in **A**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Another view of instantaneous load. Since power is related to voltage and current, this feature is strongly tied to consumption peaks and can help models detect high-load periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_1\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by the **kitchen** appliance group during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Provides appliance-group breakdown of consumption, supporting more detailed behavioural analysis (cooking patterns) and enabling models to learn which activities drive peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_2\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by the **laundry room** appliance group during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Helps identify energy usage linked to washing/drying routines and supports targeted insights (e.g., shifting laundry to cheaper hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sub_metering_3\n",
    "- **Meaning:** **Active energy** consumed by **electric water heating and air conditioning** during that minute (in **Wh**).\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Often linked to strong **seasonal effects** (heating/cooling). It is key for analysing winter/summer consumption patterns and improving forecasting.\n"

Implementing the models from scratch would significantly increase development time and the likelihood of implementation errors, while offering limited benefit for the scope of this practical work.
